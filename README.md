# Beyond the Horizon

I. INTRO: 

  1. Beyond the Horizon Site: https://beyondthehorizon.netlify.app/

  2. This is an App that pulls an Astronomy Pic of the Day from NASA's Archives, App then displays:
  
     a. Astronomy Pic of the Day (APOD).
     
     b. Brief Text to provide Context for the Image.

II. NOTES:

  1. Built with HTML/CSS/JS/API.
  
  2. NASA API: https://api.nasa.gov/
  
  3. As a Freelance Website and Web App Developer, I was able to license this App to a Private Tutor for 12 months use.

III. OPTIMIZATION:

  1. Add an Input where a User can type either a Date (MM/DD/YYYY) or a Day (Monday/Tuesday/Wednesday). 
  
  2. Write Async/Await code to pull from NASA's APOD based on Date.
  
  3. Write Async/Await code to pull a random APOD based on Day, regardless of Year.
  
  4. Modify JS and Fetch to enable Video Display, not just Image Display.

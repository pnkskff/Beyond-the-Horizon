# Beyond-the-Horizon
Beyond the Horizon Site: https://beyondthehorizon.netlify.app/

This is an Educational App I built for my Nephew! 
In this Version 1, it's displaying NASA's Picture of the Day.
However, in future versions, I want to make it so that a User can search other Pictures from Past Days!

Built with HTML/CSS/JS/API - Nothing too fancy!

With this App, I use this eperience to learn more about customizing the Data from API's and how to display it on my Apps.

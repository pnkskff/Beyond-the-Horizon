# Beyond-the-Horizon
Beyond the Horizon Site: https://beyondthehorizon.netlify.app/

This is an Educational App I built for my Nephew! 

In this Version 1, it's displaying NASA's Picture of the Day. However, in future versions, I want to make it so that a User can search other Pictures from Past Days!

Built with HTML/CSS/JS/API - Nothing too fancy!
